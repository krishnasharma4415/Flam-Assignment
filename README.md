Flam AR Feature Proposal: Social Stories Integration
The Problem We Need to Solve
Current Challenge: Users scan QR codes and experience amazing AR content, but many don't share it on social media. This means brands miss out on free marketing and viral reach.
Why This Matters:
Only 30% of users currently share their AR experiences
Brands want more people to see their content online
Users want easy ways to show friends cool experiences
Sharing creates more brand awareness without extra cost
The Solution: Built-in Social Stories Feature
What Is It?
A simple tool inside Flam's AR camera that lets users create and share short video stories of their AR experience - similar to Instagram or Snapchat stories.
How It Works:
During AR Experience: User sees a "Record Story" button
Smart Recording: App records 15-30 seconds of the best AR moments
Quick Editing: User can add text, stickers, or brand hashtags

Brand Benefits: Each story includes the brand's logo and QR code
